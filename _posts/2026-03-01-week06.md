**Week 5 Reflection**
I hope to contribute to a practical and user-focused open source project with my group. Since my background is in computer science and game development, I am especially interested in projects related to interactive applications.

However, there are some things that may stand in our way. One challenge is understanding a large existing codebase, which can take time at the beginning. Another possible obstacle is coordinating schedules and communication within the team, since everyone is busy with other coursework. In addition, learning the project’s contribution workflow and coding style may require some adjustment.

I know I can contribute to the group in several ways. I am comfortable reading code, debugging, and implementing small features. I can also help improve documentation and organize tasks because I have experience managing my own game projects.

So far, my small contributions are going steadily. I have helped review the repository structure, made minor code improvements, and assisted with documentation updates. The biggest challenge has been getting fully familiar with the project architecture and making sure my changes match the existing style.
