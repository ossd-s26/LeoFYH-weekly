**Video Reflection**
The Code of Conduct activity raised important questions about why rules are needed in open source projects. Even though open source emphasizes openness and freedom, a Code of Conduct helps set clear expectations for respectful behavior. It protects contributors from harassment, encourages inclusive participation, and provides guidance on how conflicts should be handled. Without it, power imbalances and misunderstandings can easily discourage people from contributing.

The presentation emphasized that consensus does not mean everyone fully agrees, but that everyone has been heard and understands the decision. Transparency plays a key role in this process. By making discussions, decisions, and documentation open, communities build trust and reduce confusion. Tools such as public issue trackers, RFCs, and open communication channels help contributors follow the reasoning behind decisions.

Overall, the presentation helped me understand that strong open source communities rely not only on good code, but also on clear processes, transparent decision-making, and shared behavioral standards. A Code of Conduct supports these values by creating a safe environment where collaboration and consensus can thrive.

**Reflection of Code of Conduct Activity**

The Go project’s Code of Conduct is useful because it clearly tells people how to behave in the community. Open source projects include people from different cultures and backgrounds, so conflicts can easily happen. Having rules written down helps prevent harassment and makes new contributors feel safer. It also shows that the project cares about respect and inclusion, not just coding skills. Compared to the Contributor Covenant, Go’s version feels more specific to its own community and communication spaces. It is also less formal in tone. They probably changed it to better match their own culture and make the rules feel more practical.



The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct feels more general and value-focused compared to Go’s. It talks a lot about respect, collaboration, and creating a welcoming space, but it doesn’t go into as many detailed behavior examples. Since Sugar Labs works in education, this makes sense because their community includes students and teachers, not just developers. The language is simple and approachable. It seems like the document may be based on an existing template because the wording sounds similar to other community guidelines. Unlike Go’s more customized version, this one feels broader and designed to fit a mixed learning environment.

I looked at the Python project as another example. Their Code of Conduct is more structured and formal than Go’s and much more detailed than Sugar Labs’. It includes clear examples of unacceptable behavior and explains how to report problems. This probably reflects the size of the Python community, which is very large and global. Compared to the simpler style of Sugar Labs, Python’s version feels more like an official governance document. This shows that bigger projects often need more detailed processes, while smaller or education-focused communities can rely on simpler guidelines.
