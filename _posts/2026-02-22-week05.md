**Week 5 Reflection**
This week, although I was unable to attend the live presentations, I reviewed several student projects. One extension that particularly caught my attention was **Mind Melt**. I found the idea very creative and memorable. Instead of improving productivity, the extension intentionally disrupts the YouTube viewing experience by fading the screen, altering audio, and so on. This showed me that browser extensions can also be used to create experimental or artistic experiences, not just practical tools. It was interesting to see how a simple technical implementation can produce such a strong and unique user feeling.

My biggest takeaway from our group work was the critical importance of clear communication and early alignment on technical decisions. At the beginning, small misunderstandings about goals and implementation choices created unnecessary confusion. As we improved our check-ins and clarified responsibilities, our workflow became much smoother and more efficient.

In place of Wednesday’s class, I watched the three assigned videos. A major theme across them was that successful open-source collaboration depends heavily on communication. Clear documentation, small incremental contributions, and respectful community interaction were repeatedly emphasized. I realized that writing good code alone is not enough; making the project approachable for contributors is equally important.

Watching the three videos helped me better understand what makes a presentation effective. One of my biggest takeaways is the importance of clarity and focus. The speakers organized their talks around a few strong core ideas instead of trying to cover too many details. This made their presentations easier to follow and more memorable. 

Another thing I learned is the value of a natural and conversational delivery style. The presenters used real-world examples and spoke in a way that felt engaging rather than scripted. They also used pauses and emphasis effectively to highlight important points.
