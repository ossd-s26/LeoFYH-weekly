The Code of Conduct activity raised important questions about why rules are needed in open source projects. Even though open source emphasizes openness and freedom, a Code of Conduct helps set clear expectations for respectful behavior. It protects contributors from harassment, encourages inclusive participation, and provides guidance on how conflicts should be handled. Without it, power imbalances and misunderstandings can easily discourage people from contributing.

The presentation emphasized that consensus does not mean everyone fully agrees, but that everyone has been heard and understands the decision. Transparency plays a key role in this process. By making discussions, decisions, and documentation open, communities build trust and reduce confusion. Tools such as public issue trackers, RFCs, and open communication channels help contributors follow the reasoning behind decisions.

Overall, the presentation helped me understand that strong open source communities rely not only on good code, but also on clear processes, transparent decision-making, and shared behavioral standards. A Code of Conduct supports these values by creating a safe environment where collaboration and consensus can thrive.
