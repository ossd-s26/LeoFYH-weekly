**Week 3 progress**
This week our team worked on planning our first open source project and discussing possible ideas for a Chrome extension. We came up with several options, including a Google Docs dark mode tool, a homework or assignment reminder connected to school websites, and a tab color changer. After considering difficulty and time limits, we decided the Tab Color Changer is the most realistic choice for our first project.

One challenge we faced was choosing between creative ideas and what we could actually complete. Some ideas sounded exciting but required more technical knowledge and permissions. A positive part of our teamwork was that everyone shared ideas and listened to each other.

My role was helping evaluate which idea was practical and helping describe the project clearly. Lastly, we decided to choose tab color changer. My biggest contribution was providing the creative idea of tab color changer. I also help to evaluate other ideas in term of coding and designing.
